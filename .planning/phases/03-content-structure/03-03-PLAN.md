<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add direct answers and dates to all 3 case study articles</name>
  <files>lib/content/case-studies.ts</files>
  <action>
For each of the 3 case study articles in case-studies.ts, add these 4 fields after heroImage and before persona:

1. **tanaka-tax-office**
```typescript
directAnswerEn: "A solo tax accountant saved 60 hours monthly by automating inquiry responses, invoice collection, and report generation. AI handles 80% of client communications while collection rate improved from 78% to 95%, enabling 12 new clients without additional staff.",
directAnswerJa: "一人税理士が問い合わせ対応・請求書回収・報告書作成を自動化し月60時間を削減。AIが顧客対応の80%を処理、回収率78%→95%に改善。追加スタッフなしで新規12社を獲得。",
datePublished: "2026-01-20",
dateModified: "2026-02-12",
```

2. **sato-wellness-shop**
```typescript
directAnswerEn: "An organic e-commerce brand reduced SNS content creation from 2 hours daily to 15 minutes while growing organic traffic 180%. Automated customer segmentation improved repeat purchase rate from 22% to 38%, adding 2.4M yen annual revenue.",
directAnswerJa: "オーガニックECがSNS作業を1日2時間から15分に短縮、オーガニック流入180%成長。自動顧客セグメンテーションでリピート率22%→38%に改善、年間240万円の売上増。",
datePublished: "2026-01-20",
dateModified: "2026-02-12",
```

3. **yamamoto-consulting**
```typescript
directAnswerEn: "A solo consultant grew new qualified leads from 0 to 8-12 monthly through automated prospecting. AI-powered invoice collection eliminated payment chasing discomfort while competitive intelligence briefings enabled proactive strategy, adding 5M yen annual revenue.",
directAnswerJa: "一人コンサルタントが自動化リード獲得で新規見込み客を月0件から8〜12件に。AI請求書回収で催促の心理的負担を解消、競合情報ブリーフィングで能動的戦略を実現し年間500万円の売上増。",
datePublished: "2026-01-20",
dateModified: "2026-02-12",
```

Each direct answer must:
- Be 40-60 words (English) / equivalent Japanese
- Answer "What was achieved in this case study?" directly
- Include specific metrics (time saved, revenue impact, rate improvements)
- Be self-contained (works as standalone excerpt for AI citation)
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no TypeScript errors in case-studies.ts. Verify all 3 articles have the 4 new fields.</verify>
  <done>All 3 case study articles have directAnswerEn, directAnswerJa, datePublished, and dateModified fields with metric-rich, self-contained content.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update CaseStudyDetail component to render direct answer and date</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/cases/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the CaseStudyDetail component in the article detail page to display direct answers and dates.

In CaseStudyDetail component, after the Title h1 and before Hero Image, add:
```tsx
{/* Direct Answer - AI extraction optimized */}
<p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-foreground/90 font-medium leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
  {locale === 'en' ? article.directAnswerEn : article.directAnswerJa}
</p>

{/* Last Updated - Freshness signal */}
<div className="flex justify-center">
  <LastUpdated date={article.dateModified} locale={locale} />
</div>
```

Note: LastUpdated import was already added in Plan 03-02. This task only modifies CaseStudyDetail function.

Place direct answer and date between title and hero image to ensure it's the first substantial text content (ideal for AI extraction).
  </action>
  <verify>Run the dev server and visit a case study page (e.g., /en/cases/sato-wellness-shop). Verify direct answer paragraph appears below title and LastUpdated date appears below that, before the hero image.</verify>
  <done>CaseStudyDetail component renders direct answer paragraph and LastUpdated component between title and hero image.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Optimize static page intro paragraphs for AI extraction</name>
  <files>app/[locale]/what-i-do/page.tsx, app/[locale]/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the intro paragraphs on key static pages to follow the direct answer pattern (under 50 words, answers the page's implied question directly).

**what-i-do/page.tsx** - Update translations.intro:

English (answer "What do you do?"):
```typescript
intro: "I automate your winning business patterns with n8n and AI. My systems handle inquiries, invoicing, content creation, and customer follow-ups — reducing manual work by 60+ hours monthly while keeping you in control of strategy.",
```
(47 words, direct, specific, standalone)

Japanese:
```typescript
intro: "n8nとAIであなたの勝ちパターンを自動化。問い合わせ対応、請求書発行、コンテンツ制作、顧客フォローアップをシステム化し、月60時間以上の手作業を削減。戦略はあなたがコントロール。",
```

**about/page.tsx** - Read current file first, then update the intro/bio paragraph.

Find the intro text in translations (likely under 'bio' or 'intro' key) and update to:

English (answer "Who is this person?"):
```typescript
intro: "I'm a marketing operations specialist who builds automation systems for solo business owners. I transform manual winning patterns into AI-powered workflows using n8n, helping clients save 60+ hours monthly and focus on growth strategy.",
```
(40 words, direct, establishes expertise and value)

Japanese:
```typescript
intro: "一人法人向け自動化システムを構築するマーケティングオペレーション専門家。手動の勝ちパターンをn8nとAIワークフローに変換し、クライアントが月60時間以上を節約して成長戦略に集中できるよう支援。",
```

Key principles for direct answer intros:
- Answer the page's implied question in the first sentence
- Include specific value proposition (what you do / achieve)
- Keep under 50 words
- Avoid "In today's world..." or "Welcome to..." openings
  </action>
  <verify>Read both updated files and count words in intro paragraphs. English intros should be under 50 words. Test by visiting /en/what-i-do and /en/about to see updated content.</verify>
  <done>what-i-do and about pages have direct answer intro paragraphs under 50 words that answer the page's implied question directly.</done>
</task>
