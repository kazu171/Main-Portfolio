# Roadmap: AEO/GEO Optimization Project

## Overview

This roadmap transforms an existing Next.js portfolio (12 workflow articles + 3 case studies) into an AI-search-optimized lead generation engine. The journey progresses from technical foundation (crawler access, sitemap) through structured data implementation (Schema.org types) and content enhancement (citations, statistics, E-E-AT signals) to conversion optimization. Each phase delivers observable improvements in AI search visibility, building toward the goal of 10 inquiries per week within 1 month.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Content Structure** - Paragraph optimization and heading hierarchy
- [ ] **Phase 4: Article Schema** - Article markup with publication dates
- [ ] **Phase 5: E-E-AT Signals** - Author profiles and expertise display
- [ ] **Phase 6: FAQ System** - FAQ content creation and FAQPage schema
- [ ] **Phase 7: Citations & Statistics** - Content credibility enhancement
- [ ] **Phase 8: HowTo Schema** - Step-by-step workflow article markup
- [ ] **Phase 9: Conversion Optimization** - CTA and contact flow optimization
- [ ] **Phase 10: Validation & Launch** - Schema validation and cross-platform testing
